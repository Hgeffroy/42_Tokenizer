# General concepts

## Token vs Cryptocurrency

Both digital assets in the blockchain but:
- Cryptocurrency is inherent to the blockchain
- A token is an asset existing on the blockchain but still needs the blockchain currency (called gas fee) to use its features

## Mining vs minting

- Mining: Validatng transactions and getting rewarded for it
- Minting: Creating a new token

## ERC20

- Norm to create a token on a blockchain

## Ethereum

- Cryptocurrency = ether
- Language = Solidity
- Advantages: secure, immutable, ???
- Drawbacks: Slow, ???

# Tools

- Remix: online IDE to test smartcontracts without needing to deploy them
- Hardhat: Solidity framework to facilitate token development and deployment

# Token features

- ERC20: inherited from openzeppelin ERC20 contract
- Initial supply: Given to owner at contract creation
- Max supply: Max token that can be minted
- Token is burnable: Owner can remove tokens he owns (can be used to manipulate token value)
- Reward for miners
